Description: Builds prediction interval for cell type annotation using conformal 
    inference and conformal risk control.
    It provides two main methods. The first one gives prediction intervals with 
    coverage guarantees based on standard conformal inference. The second one 
    instead gives hierarchical prediction intervals that are consistent
    with the cell ontology.
