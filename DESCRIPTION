Description: Builds prediction interval for cell type annotation using conformal inference and conformal risk control.
    It provides two main methods. The first one gives prediction intervals with coverage guarantees based 
    on standard conformal inference. The second one instead gives hierarchical prediction intervals that are consistent
    with the cell ontology.
